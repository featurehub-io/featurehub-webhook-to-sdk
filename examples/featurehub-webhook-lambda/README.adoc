= AWS Lambda

The AWS Lamba example is designed to show how you can write a simple entrypoint
in a lamba, and store the data into s3 as it is transformed. 

You can load it from s3 into your SDK via http or the s3 api depending on whether
it is included in your own application. 

== Running up the example locally

The local example uses localstack via docker-compose, you need to authenticate locally,
which will set up testing credentials, and then bring up localstack with docker-compose.

Create the bucket with

 $ awslocal s3 mb s3://sdk-bucket

The example runs in your local shell, so a simple

 $ npm run example

takes the sample data and puts it into the associated bucket.

It is expect that your own organisation has rules and regulations around how lambdas
are built and deployed so that is not attempted in this example.
